## Deena Bernett

Note: I'm auditing this class, so you don't actually have to grade this unless you really want to.

### Personal


I'm *old*. I'm married with two kids (ages 5 and 8), and I live far from Hyde Park. Which, makes things fun.

###Professional

I worked as a teacher in low-income urban public and charter schools for a decade before going back to school.

[Here's](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=155528367800318 "Deena Teaching") a video of me teaching.

###Academic

I have a lot of degrees:

* B.S. in Biology from **Brown** in 2003
* M.A. in Biology Teacher from **CUNY** in 2006
* M.A. in Cognitive Studies in Education from **Columbia - Teachers College** in 2015
* M.A. in Psychology (on my way to my Ph.D.) from **U Chicago** in 2017.  

I hope to get my Ph.D. from U Chicago in 2020. Five degrees seems like enough, don't you think?

I study learning and memory, with a specific emphasis on how people learn math.

###*The End!*
