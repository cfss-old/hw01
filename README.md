Intro
=====

Hi there! My name is Jerry Shi and I'm currently a Second Year Business Economics major at the University of Chicago. I'm writing this readme for the very first assignment of the class ["Computing for the Social Sciences"](https://cfss.uchicago.edu). In my spare time, some of my hobbies include

 * crew
 * yoga
 * going to live concerts
 * exploring downtown (which I *definitely* do not do enough!)
 
A little more about me
----------------------

1. Hometown?

I grew up all over the place! Born in Reno, then lived in SoCal (LA & San Diego) through middle school, then went to high school in Indiana.

2. Favorite food?

Thai rolled ice cream

3. Favorite genre of music?

Pop all the way

4. Fun fact?

Chinese was my first language since I lived with my grandparents in China as a baby! Now English is the language I'm better at though, having grown up in the US.
