Repository for homework 01

####### HOMEWORK 1 BY DOMINIC DICARLO

*Dom at a glance:*

* Third Year Undergraduate in Psychology
* Runner, Swimmer, Biker, and Martial Artist
* Jack of all trades hoping to eventually be a master of one

*Recent Interesting Experience:*

* I went on a 10 day silent meditation retreat over winter break! You can learn about the program [here](http://dhamma.org)

*"So, how did you complete this homework?"*

* I first installed git, R, and R studio on my computer. Then I forked the repo from the class hw1 directory to my own github, where I then cloned the repo onto my computer. I opened the markdown file in R Studio and I used the git markdown guide to learn how to add emphasis, make headings, and create lists. I saved the markdown file, added it to git, and then committed my add.
