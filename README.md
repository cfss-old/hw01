## Education Background

### Undergraduate Study  
I completed my undergraduate degree at the [**University of Minnesota - Twin Cities**](https://umn.edu) in 2014. There I studied in an interdisciplinary department with focus areas in biology (re: evolution) and psychology. 

### Graduate Study  
I am currently a MAPSS student at the [**University of Chicago**](https://mapss.uchicago.edu). In my research, I am broadly focused on social emotions and their evolutionary functions. Specifically, I am working on a project examining shame as the product of an individual working to avoid, prevent, or remedy for a behavior that has or might damage their reputation.  

### What's Next?
While finishing up my thesis project in August 2019, I am planning to submit applications to medical school. I am hoping to apply my understanding of the psychology of emotions to a psychiatric practice and help people to better balance life with a mental illness.
