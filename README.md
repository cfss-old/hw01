My name is Sion, and I am currently a MAPSS student in Political Science, specifically in American politics. I am interested in public opinion on socioeconomic issues, particularly policies like 
* Medicare, 
* Social Security
* The social safety net
and political beliefs on broad questions like how large or small the government should be. For my thesis, I am employing data from the *American National Election Studies* and the *General Social Survey*.

As an undergraduate, I majored in Anthropology and African American Studies at the University of Kansas.
