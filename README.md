### Biography of Yan Hao Ng

My name is Yan Hao Ng, and I am a Masters student in the Committee of International Relations course.

I am an international student from Singapore.

I have used GUI-based programs like Stata before to write simple commands. I have taken courses in statistics (econometrics) at the undergraduate level.

I hope to learn how to use R and learn basic coding skills from this course.

This is my first coding class. *__I am a fish out of water.__*

The steps which were used to make and upload these edits are noted below.

###Steps:
1. Install the r markdown package.

2. Open the hw01 project in R Studio from the URL provided on the personal Github page.

3. Read the online guides to understand R markdown functions available at https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html and
https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/github-and-rstudio/

4. ~~Watch a youtube video to sort out confusion about the knit function.~~

5. Follow the steps as laid out by the second hyperlink to commit and push the changes to Github.

###Difficulties:

* Understanding what Markdown is for and how it works. Reading the guides was useful for this.

* Getting used to the R interface, and finding the effective console to use to make the edits. I had to watch a youtube video to confirm this.

* Uploading the profile picture was problematic. I had to Google around for solutions to upload a URL to the Repo. Luckily I had a decent picture of myself online.
