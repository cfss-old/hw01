## Reflections for HW01

### Challenges in the assignment:

1. Markdown is does not illsutrate how syntax changes would be reflected on the website compared to GUI. Thus I have to constantly check on github and adjust how I use syntaxes. 
1. Finding a link of a picture usable for the introduction takes a bit more effort.

### What helped in the assignment:

1. The github guide for markdown comes really handy.
