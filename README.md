# Eitan's Homework #1: A Brief Biography

My story begins in Brooklyn on April 2nd, 1998. I went to to Poly Prep Country Day School in Brooklyn where I was primarily engaged in high school debate. Now a Junior at the University of Chicago majoring in *Political Science* and *Psychology*. 

### Career Goals

I have changed my decision on what I would like to do several times in my college career. I started out sure that I wanted to go to law school, then flirted with the idea of consulting or working at a startup, and am now back to thinking I would like to go to law school at some point. My linkedin is attached [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eitan-ezra-35b53b165/) if you'd like a visual representation of what I've been doing with my time in the past. 

### My Interests

My life is not just school work. in my free time I like to:

1. Read primarily about international relations.
2. Play basketball even though I'm still *very* bad.
3. Watch **mindless** Netflix shows about solving crimes.

### Why I'm Here

I've always wanted to learn some programming, but I've never found a great opportunity to do it at the University of Chicago. I'm incredibly excited to use this class as a jumping point to learn even more progamming skills that I can hopefully apply to whatever I do!
