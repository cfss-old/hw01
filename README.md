Hello, my name is Isaac. I am in the MAPSS Program, and I study political theory. You might be wondering why, if I study political theory, I am bothering to learn R. You are right that I certainly don't need it for pol. theory! But I am not sure that that pol. theory is going to get me a job (unless I stay in academia), so I thought it would be a good idea to learn some data skills in the hope that it would open up some jobs for me that for which I wouldn't be competitive with only my theory skills. 
And it turns out that R is __FUN__!!
