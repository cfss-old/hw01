# Allison Whiting's Bio

<<<<<<< HEAD
I have a BA in Global Studies from the University of Southern California and I am currently a master's student in the Committee on International Relations Program - https://cir.uchicago.edu.  I wanted to take this class because **I do not** have any experience with quantitative or computational methods, but have seen that my purely qualitative focus could be a disadvantage as I am searching for a job in research.

###My general research interests include things like:###
* Citizenship
* Nationalism
* Migration
* Multiculturalism
* The State
