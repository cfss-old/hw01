# Reflections for HW01

## How I got changes into README.md 

1. I forked HW01 from class github and, pulled the repo github. 
1. I opened a new project with git and opened "README.md" from files coloum.
1. I used markdown language to write my introductions, save the file and use commit the changes through Git.
1. I push the button to update the changes to github, and go to github to check how the README.md looks like. 
1. Making adjustmentsand repeat step three until finishing editing. 


## Challenges in the assignment:

1. Markdown is does not illsutrate how syntax changes would be reflected on the website compared to GUI. Thus I have to constantly check on github and adjust how I use syntaxes. 
1. Finding a direct link of a picture usable for the introduction takes a bit more effort.

## What helped in the assignment:

1. The github guide for markdown comes really handy. 
1. Git is very helpful in keeping track of different versions. When I realized that I was in a dead end finding reliable direct link to images from various cloud services (google/onedrive/dropbox), I could easily roll back to the earlier version before the changes.
