# Homework 1: Hello, hello!

My name is Cleo Nevakivi-Callanan. I am a MAPSS student focused on historyâ€” so I find computers very confusing! I was born in Helsinki but hail from Brooklyn. So yeah!

### Academics and all that
Currently, I'm researching the experiences of American and Finnish adolescents during World War II for my thesis and working as a research assistant for Prof. Kathleen Belew.

### Interests
In my free time, I enjoy reading (non-academic books), visiting museums, playing violin, drawing, and doing yoga.

Also... **I LOVE BUNNIES!**

Here is a bunny, that I love:

*TL;DR I love bunnies*

### Computer Science and all that
In general, I've found this all a little confusing, but *I think* this is what I ultimately came up with:

1. I had to download a bunch of things including:
       + Git
       + R and Rstudio
       + XCode - this took me lots of TA help. Thank you!
       + Various packages
2. I set up an account with GitHub account, in which I forked, i.e. made an independent copy, of the pre-existing assignment.
3. I linked my RStudio to Git
       + This was very confusing, because RStudio was having trouble linking to Git. Ultimately, it turned out that the file path that it was looking for git was missing a /local/. I figured this out from the shell (terminal) by running a search command for Git and then following that filepath in RStudio.
4. I pulled changes from the ReadMe.md document onto RStudio.
       + I found this confusing as well, because I wasn't aware that the Readme and the Homework 1.RProj were part of the same thing. Now I've understood that the Homework 1 RProj essentially functions as a folder for the document.
5. I am typing this text now.
       + I found RStudio's guide for Markdown helpful.
6. Then I will commit the changes.
7. Then push it to GitHub so that you can read it.

I think that's right?
