# Who is Yeon Jang?  

Hi all, I'm Yeon. I am a MAPSS student with a concentration in Psychology. For my thesis, I'm currently studying the effects of community violence exposure on the neurodevelopment of adolescents. Prior to UChicago, I completed my undergraduate education in Minnesota at Carleton College. In case you've never heard of Carleton, here's a link to their website: [Carleton College Website](https://www.carleton.edu/).  

Outside of school, I enjoy running, listening to music, and watching tv. *I don't have a lot of hobbies...*  
Here's a few of my favorite shows:

ALSO, I'm a major Jets fan!
